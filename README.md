## What's GameTime about?

GameTime is the perfect companion for managing the game and shot clock in basketball games. With an intuitive interface, you can easily stop, start, and reset the shot clock to 24 or 14 seconds with a single tap. Stay on top of the action with audio cues—a warning sound plays in the last 5 seconds of the shot clock, while the final 10 seconds of the game clock trigger a countdown. When time runs out, a buzzer sounds, ensuring every moment is officiated smoothly. 📣

Take control of the game with GameTime! 💪🏀
